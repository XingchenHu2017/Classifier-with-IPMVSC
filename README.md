Matlab code for IEEE TKDE 2022 "Multi-view Fuzzy Classification with Subspace Clustering and Information Granules"

# Introduction
Abstract
Multi-view learning becomes increasingly attractive and promising because multimodal or multi-view data are commonly encountered in real-world applications. In this study, we develop a novel multi-view Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy system framework to handle classification problems for such data. We propose an anchor and graph subspace clustering strategy to discover and represent the actual latent data distribution for each view separately. In this way, the discriminate anchors (landmarks) are learned to capture the main structure of the multi-view data. This strategy also provides a computationally efficient clustering algorithm with respect to the number of instances. These resulting anchors are formed as the prototypes of information granules (IGs) for fuzzy modeling. Then we construct an information-granule-based multi-view TSK fuzzy classification model inherited from the natural interpretability of fuzzy rule-based systems. Concretely, the relationship between the multi-view input and label output spaces is depicted by IGs-oriented fuzzy rules. The experimental studies involve various commonly used benchmark datasets, which indicate that our proposed method achieves comparable or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
